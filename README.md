# My Portfolio (V8.2 - Projects + "About Me" Section Update)

Welcome!  
You’ve reached the repository for my personal developer portfolio. While there’s still more I plan to add, here are some key features that are already live:

## Features
- Animated & interactive user interface
- Dedicated “About Me” page with detailed background
- Interactive project showcase with real-time links
- Enhanced contact form with validation
- Extended responsive design across all screen sizes
- Minimalist, modern, and clean aesthetic
- Well-structured codebase using semantic HTML, scoped styles, and clear comments

## Known Issues
Although I thoroughly test the website before deploying updates, some issues may only surface in production.

As of **6/17/2025**, the following issues are known:
- `typewriter-effect` introduces horizontal overflow on smaller screens during animation.

I aim to improve the portfolio **monthly**, including fixing bugs, adding features, and optimizing performance.

## Bug Tracking

All portfolio-related issues and tasks are tracked using **JIRA** to ensure structured development and continuous improvement.  
While my JIRA board is currently private, it reflects an organized Agile workflow with sprint planning, issue prioritization, and backlog management.
